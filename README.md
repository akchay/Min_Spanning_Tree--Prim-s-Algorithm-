Min_Spanning_Tree--Prim-s-Algorithm-
====================================

Implemented Primâ€™s Minimum Cost Spanning Tree algorithm, by using arrays (simple scheme), as well as by using Fibonacci heap (f-heap scheme), and recorded the relative performance of the two schemes for thousand of nodes with different edge densities.
